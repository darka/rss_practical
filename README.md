=============

Code for Robotics (RSS) practical.

Goal was to build and program a robot capable of moving around a lab, 
collecting small boxes and bringing them to a designated base.

The vision system uses quite a lot of tricks to achieve fairly accurate box detection.

A lot of this was rushed, but might still be useful for someone taking the 
course at the University of Edinburgh.
